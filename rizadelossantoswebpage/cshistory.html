            <p>Under the vigilant stewardship of Dr. Virgilio de los Santos, the University has been placed to a higher level of credit and standard. In line with the thrusts of the government and to keep abreast with the demands of the modern times, on February 16, 1994, the University offered four-year courses in Computer Science. To show further that the University of Manila has come of age and in response to the call of the 90’s, on February 21, 1994, it offered new courses in the following programs: Doctor of Education, Doctor of Public Administration, and Master of Business Administration. These programs are designed to provide administrators, businessmen, analysts, researchers, and educators with the theoretical background, values, competencies, and skills for them to be able to participate and contribute to the growth and development of a better and a more humane society.</p>
